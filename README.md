# Distributed-Software-Architecture

## Pipe-and-Filter (Lab1)
The objective of this assignment is to develop an appreciation of architectural patterns/styles and their impact on systemic properties. This assignment will use the pipe-and-filter architectural pattern as an exemplar. This assignment will be implementation-oriented, allowing you to experiment with a particular pipe-and-filter implementation strategy in order to gain a clearer understanding of the issues associated with carrying an architectural design through to code.

## Implicit-Invocation System (Lab2)
The objective of this assignment is to better understand implicit-invocation architectures. This 
assignment will be implementation-oriented, allowing you to experiment with a system that employs 
implicit invocation in order to gain a clearer understanding of the issues associated with carrying an 
architectural design through to code.
