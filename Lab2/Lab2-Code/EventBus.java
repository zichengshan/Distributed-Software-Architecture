 * as integer codes before use. Internally, <code>Observer</code>/<code>Observable</code> classes
 * are used for implementation, which means event passing between two components only works within
 * single address space (for now). Note that none of the components are typed as an <code>Observable</code>
 * object. This ensures that the existence of other components is completely hidden to a component
 * and it's safe to subscribe to an event when there is no component that can announce the event.
